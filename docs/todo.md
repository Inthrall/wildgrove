# Placeholder & TODO manifest

A living list of the deliberate placeholders and deferred work in the codebase, so
nothing quietly ships as "done". Grouped by the phase that retires it (see
`design-doc.md` §12 MVP development plan). Keep entries pointing at the code so
they're easy to find and delete when resolved.

## Phase 1 — Core loop slice (current)

- **Tending burst values are a first guess.** `burstYieldMult` / `burstDurationSec`
  in `design/data/economy.json` aren't in the design doc — tune once the loop is
  playable. (`$note` in the file.)
- **Feeder base amount is a first guess.** `gifts.carrierBaseGoods = 8` — N of each
  worked resource per carrier (design §13 Feeder). Watch the Phase 3 zone unlocks:
  the bundle broadens as new nodes come into work, so a freshly-gifted node briefly
  raises the carrier price in a resource the camp barely holds — probably desirable
  tension, but confirm it in balance.
- **Hand-gather rate is a first guess.** `tending.handGatherPerSecond = 0.5` — the
  warden's trickle while a burst is live, and the bare-node gift bootstrap. Tune so
  a first gift feels like a few taps, not a grind.
- **Telemetry sink is the Unity log, not Firebase.** The design calls for
  Crashlytics + GA events from Phase 1; the events (session_start/end,
  upgrade_purchased, familiar_gifted, welcome_back) are instrumented behind
  `ITelemetry`, but the sink is `UnityLogTelemetry` (Debug.Log / logcat) until the
  Firebase side exists. Remaining steps: create the Firebase project + register
  `com.inthrall.wildgrove` and download `google-services.json` (console work), then
  import the Firebase Unity SDK (Analytics + Crashlytics) and swap the sink in
  `GameLoop.Initialise`. Note the SDK's External Dependency Manager patches
  `mainTemplate.gradle` — re-check the hand-authored Kotlin pins when it lands.
  (`Assets/Scripts/Game/Telemetry/`)
- **Autosave interval (30 s) and welcome-back threshold (60 s credited) are first
  guesses.** Tune with the loop playtest. (`GameLoop.AutosaveIntervalSeconds`,
  `GameHud.WelcomeBackMinSeconds`)
- **The upgrade shop shows the next 3 unpurchased rungs.** A window over the §9
  ladder in order; material-costed rungs appear (with their costs shown) before
  crafting exists to pay them — an honest preview, but they sit unaffordable
  until the crafting system lands. (`GameHud.UpgradeShopWindow`)

## Phase 2 — Adaptive UI & input

- **HUD is programmer-art, built in code.** `GameHud` constructs uGUI at runtime with
  flat colours and `LayoutGroup`s; real responsive layout (phone-portrait column ↔
  landscape dashboard) is the Phase 2 job. (`Assets/Scripts/Game/GameHud.cs`)
- **Legacy `Text` + `LegacyRuntime.ttf` builtin font.** Chosen to avoid the
  TextMeshPro essentials import for placeholder UI; swap to TMP with a real naturalist
  typeface when the art direction lands. (`GameHud`)
- **Node sprites are runtime-generated placeholder discs in a screen strip.**
  `PlaceholderArt` makes one tinted disc per resource and `WorldView` lays them out
  in the gap the HUD leaves open; the hand-drawn naturalist plates and a real region
  scene replace them (the camera/world seam and screen-point hit test stay).
  (`Assets/Scripts/Game/World/`)
- **The lower panel scrolls rather than adapting.** The node/shop/crafting/camp
  sections sit in a height-capped scroll view (45% of canvas height) with the
  actions row and hint pinned below — so the column can't outgrow portrait, but
  it's still a single list. Per-zone collapsing and the landscape dashboard are
  the remaining Phase 2 job; on short landscape screens the scroll section
  absorbs the squeeze and the world strip can collapse to nothing.
  (`GameHud.BuildScrollSection`, `HeightClampedElement`)
- **Gamepad South double-fire.** Pad-South is also uGUI's Submit, so tending while a
  widget is focused can fire both the button and the tend. Fix in the controller/focus
  pass. (`GameHud.HandleTendInput`)
- **Runtime bootstrap instead of a bootstrap scene.** `Bootstrap` spawns GameLoop +
  GameHud via `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]` so Play works with zero scene setup.
  Replace with a real bootstrap scene when there's content to lay out.
  (`Assets/Scripts/Game/Bootstrap.cs`)

## Phase 3+ — Systems build-out

- **`unlockDigSite` effects are still inert.** `unlockZone` (trail maps create
  the zone's nodes), `unlockSkill` and `unlockRecipe` (both gate crafting) are
  all live; dig sites wait for the excavation system.
  (`Wildgrove.Sim/Upgrades.cs`)
- **Building perLevel values are first guesses, and two are interpretations.**
  The 5% speed/capacity tapers aren't in the design doc. Interpretive calls to
  confirm in balance: the §9 Store's "storage capacity" is implemented as
  basket capacity (camp storage caps don't exist), and the Clay Furnace is
  simply the forge line's first bought level (its ~8,000 debut price is the
  line's baseCostCoin). The Spare Wing's +1 carrier slot (§10) arrives with
  the PGS rewards layer. (`design/data/buildings.json`)
- **`crafting.baseCraftSeconds` (5 s, uniform) is a first guess.** Not in the
  design doc, and one duration for every recipe is a placeholder — tune against
  the §2 pacing targets (first recipe cooked ~20 min), and consider per-recipe
  times with the balance pass. (`design/data/economy.json`)
- **Mastery curve and value-bonus interpretation are first guesses.** base 50 /
  growth 1.15 / xpPerUnit 0.25 aren't in the design doc, and §4's "+5%
  yield/value" is implemented as one yieldBonusPerLevel applying to the node's
  yield and to the raw resource's direct sale — never to goods crafted from it
  (recipe derivation uses base values, same convention as sellValueBonus).
  (`Wildgrove.Sim/Mastery.cs`, `design/data/economy.json`)
- **Skill XP gains and recipe skillLevels are first guesses.** xp.gatherPerUnit
  (1, credited on the gross gather — basket overflow loses the goods but still
  pays XP) and xp.craftPerBatch (25) aren't in the design doc, nor are the
  per-recipe skillLevel picks (skewer/trout 2, reed baskets and bronze 3,
  iron 5). Tool-tier level gating (§4) waits for the tools system, and the
  Migration skill reset (§7) for the prestige build.
  (`Wildgrove.Sim/Skills.cs`, `design/data/recipes.json`)
- **Quality rolls land per haul batch, but nothing consumes the pools except
  the Provisioner.** Each delivery rolls once (Common/Fine/Pristine, design
  §5); Fine stock sells with the common stock at fineValueMult, Pristine
  specimens wait in the HUD's Specimens section for an explicit windfall
  sale. The Compendium (lifetime counters, plates), Museum donation, and
  Rite specimen slots all consume these pools later — a rite "specimen" is a
  unit of the quality pool of the right resource. Interpretations to confirm
  in balance: the whole batch takes the rolled tier; pristineValueMult (10×)
  isn't in the doc; hand-gather and the no-hauling fallback never roll; the
  staggered-fleet cadence and fullest-basket-first routing.
  (`Wildgrove.Sim/Quality.cs`, `Simulation.Deliver`)
- **Crafting and gifts spend only common stock.** Fine finds can't feed a
  recipe or a gift — probably right (they're for selling/offering), but it
  means a run holding only Fine berries can't gift a gatherer. Revisit with
  balance. (`Crafting`, `Economy`)
- **Hauling numbers are first guesses.** `baseCarryCapacity` / `tripSeconds` /
  `basketCapacity` in `design/data/economy.json` aren't in the design doc — tune with
  the loop playtest.
- **The Rite is data-only.** `rites.json`, `zones.verseSite`, and `dialogue.verses` are
  parsed, validated, and mapped into GameData.asset, but no runtime system consumes
  them until the Phase 3 Rite build. Validator covers slot integrity only — the full
  ≥3-slots-reachable analysis (design §7) is a Phase 3 job.
- **`NodeState.yieldMultiplier` only folds in purchased upgrades.** The tick treats
  it as a black box; `Upgrades.RecomputeYieldMultipliers` rebuilds it from yieldMult /
  yieldBonus upgrade effects, but gear and tool-tier derivation still multiply in
  with their systems. (`Assets/Scripts/Sim/Upgrades.cs`)
- **Tending's Pristine window is live but invisible.** `Simulation.Tend` opens
  the 30 s pristineBonusRemaining window (chance × (1 + pristineChanceBonus))
  alongside the yield burst, but the HUD gives no cue that it's running —
  surface it with the real art pass. (`GameHud`)
- **Verdure / almanac / museum / fossil / boost multipliers.** `Simulation.YieldPerSecond`
  folds in the Verdure global bonus only; the other multipliers arrive with their
  systems and multiply in there.

## Narrative authoring

- **MVP dialogue strings are partly empty** — the silverrun-river waystone and
  three of four verse lines in `design/data/dialogue.json` are `""`. The
  validator can't enforce non-empty text until the words are written (that's
  the §6 narrative budget, an authoring task, not a data bug); add the
  every-mvp-zone-has-text rule when they land.

## Data-layer review items (open from the data-layer PR review)

- **Skills vocabulary hardcoded** in `GameDataValidator` as a C# `HashSet` rather than
  sourced from data.
- **`zone.unlocks` is documentation-only and diverges from upgrade effects** — e.g.
  excavation is never actually granted through the unlock path.
- **`map-mistfen` grants a zone but no dig site / skills** — flagged for v1.1.

## Number formatting

- **`NumberFormat` suffix table** runs `K, M, B, T` then `aa, ab, …` before falling
  back to scientific — first-pass abbreviations; revisit if a naming convention is
  chosen. (`Assets/Scripts/Game/NumberFormat.cs`)
